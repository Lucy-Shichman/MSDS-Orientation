The CLT states that as the number of trials "n" increases, a binomial distribution with probability "p" approaches a normal distribution. This can be illustrated using R's rnorm() and rbinorm() functions.

## Proof of Concept:
Here is a binomial distribution where 10 trials (n=10) with a probability of 0.5 are repeated 100 times:
```{r}
hist(rbinom(10,100,0.5))
```

Here is the same binomial, except with 10,000 trials (n=10,000):
```{r}
hist(rbinom(10000,100,0.5))
```
